# MSCS532 Assignment 6

## Project Structure

This repository contains the code and documentation for **Assignment 6** of the MSCS532 course. It includes Python implementations and performance analysis of various data structures and algorithms.

### Files:

- `data_structure_and_implementation.py`  
  Contains the implementation of basic data structures such as Arrays, Queues, and Stacks.

- `performanc_analysis.py`  
  Performs runtime and efficiency analysis of data structure operations using timing functions and benchmarking techniques.

- `DSA-Assignment6.docx`  
  Word document containing the written report for Assignment 6.

- `README.md`  
  This file. Provides an overview of the project.

##  Objectives

- Implement and demonstrate fundamental data structures (array, queue, stack).
- Compare the performance of different operations.
- Analyze time complexity and discuss efficiency trade-offs.

---

##  Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries required (uses standard library modules like `time`)

---

##  How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Run the Python scripts using:
   ```bash
   python data_structure_and_implementation.py
   python performanc_analysis.py
